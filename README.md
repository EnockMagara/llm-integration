# Creating features that use LLMs

## Running the sample code

First, sign up for an account on https://api.together.xyz
Then, create a .env file that has your API key (similar to the .sampleenv file)

After that, run the following:

```
python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sample.py
```

## Task

You will implement a simple feature that provides users with personalized recommendations of activities to do. The starter code is in sample.py. 
You are asked to implement the function `suggest_activity` such that the code runs and provides the user with the required recommendations.

Make sure to adjust the file for any imports that are needed to implement the code.
